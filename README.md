## IoC - Dependency Injection Container for C++.

This project is just a simple implementation of constructor based dependency injection in C++. Its small and lightweight and will be taken forward and improved as its imported into various projects I have created. It has currently been implemented with constructor injection and using C++ templates. Information relating to the terms I used can be found below. As it stands this is a very simple implementation suggestions and contributors are most welcome.
